In this documents, the purposes of each of the folders in this repository are described.

3D_Structural_Files:
	This folder contains the 3D .stl files used to print out structural parts needed for this project.
	Within this folder are the files for the spraycan mount, the metal detector mount, the controller, as well as the servo mounts.


metal_detector:
	This folder contains the .ino Arduino file used to program the Arduino that handles all metal detector functionality.

rc_test and rc_test_variables:
	These files are test files used to test code ideas for rover control.
	While some of the code used in these file is present in other .ino, these files themselves are not used at all in the final product.

Rover_Code:
	This folder contains the .ino file used to program the Arduino that controls the rover. 

UNO_Controller:
	This folder contains the .ino file used to program the Arduino used to control the rover.
